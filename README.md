# MarkLogic and NetworkX Demo

This notebook demonstrates fetching data from MarkLogic's triplestore using the SPARQL endpoint. NetworkX will then take the returned dataset and run graph algorithms against that subset of the graph.

*Note: This demo assumes that you have a configured MarkLogic Server with a demo user that can read/write data from MarkLogic Server. See <https://docs.marklogic.com/11.0/guide/installation-guide/en/procedures/installing-marklogic.html> for installation and user creation <https://docs.marklogic.com/11.0/guide/security-guide/en/securing-marklogic-server.html> if needed.*
